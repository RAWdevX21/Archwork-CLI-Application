Archwork is a command line inventory program designed to revolutionize the way you manage your art collection through the _command-line interface (CLI)_. Derived from the words "**_arch_**ive" and "art**_work_**," this app embodies the power and essence of archiving with the artistry of organization. Whether you're an artist, collector, or enthusiast, Archwork provides a seamless experience while empowering you to effortlessly catalog and maintain your valuable **Archwork**.<hr>

## The SEED For Development

The creation of **Archwork** was born out of a class project and the heartfelt connection to my beloved godparents, my dads. As a tribute to their passion for art, Archwork aims to simplify the process of managing art collections, inspired by one of my dads, a celebrated artist and illustrator renowned for his captivating fashion sketch illustrations that embody the glamour of the '70s. With overflowing bins of sketches in his studio and a rich archive of artworks from various established artists and friends, the need for an efficient inventory management system became evident.

### <u>Key Challenges Addressed</u>

Managing an art collection comes with numerous challenges, some of the difficulties they encounter include:

- Keeping track of specific artworks in the archive and identifying relevant details.
- Determining the value of individual artworks for insurance purposes or potential sales.
- Mitigating risks of damage or deterioration by lacking proper documentation, including material information, environmental considerations, or previous restoration work.
- Overcoming limitations for loans, exhibitions, collaborations, or contributions to scholarly collections.
- Ensure tracing of historical context for future generations and enhancing scholarly collections.
- Addressing complexities in estate planning or ownership transfer without clear inventory documentation.

Motivated by their challenges, my dads sought my assistance in establishing a comprehensive inventory. While existing application systems provide specialized services, they often come with a hefty cost. To address this, I created Archwork‚Äîa lightweight application that simplifies documenting key information for various works. It covers details such as artists, titles, dates, mediums, dimensions, appraisal valuations, descriptions, provenance, image files, and acquisition history. In addition, Archwork introduces the innovative "vendor cart" system for seamless consignment arrangements. The vendor's cart enables consignees to build transactional orders for requested items, which are then submitted to the owner for approval. The system allows optional pricing outlines, including minimum or suggested pricing, discounts, and promotions. It also provides flexibility for specifying the consignee's commission or fee structure and outlining payment methods for sold items.<hr>
